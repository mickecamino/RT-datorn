# CÅ-833 Kommunikations-kort
A newer design that replaces CÅ-813.  
The board has three functions:  
1. Serial communication with V24, based on MC6850 and a baud generator MC14411.
2. Parallel printer output (Centronics)
3. Real Time Clock with battery backup, based on the clock chip MSM5832

This release differs from CÅ-813 that had a programmable serial IC caller INS2651, the CÅ-813A that had the 6551. This board has a MC6850 and a MC14411.

Schematic is reverse engineered from the PCB.
