flex.cfg: My configuration file.  

To read a FLEX diskette with GreaseWeazly, put the diskette you want to image in the drive, don't forget the write protection.  
Start by reading the diskette as a single sided, single density 35 track diskette:  
gw read --diskdefs flex.cfg --format flex.sssd.35 flex.img  
  
Open the image  withHcXFloppyEmulator, clock on Load Raw Image, Load Raw File, select the image file that you just created, clock on Track Analyzer.  
Hover the mouse over the third green field and type down the values for position $26 and $27, convert from HEX to decimal and you have the number of tracks and sectors for the diskette.  
If it differs from 35 track, single side single density re-read the diskette with the correct format.

The table will be expanded and flex.cfg will be updated.  

Third sector contains System Information Record (SIR) with the following format:  

| offset(hex) | size(hex) | contents
| ----------- | --------- | ------------------------- |
|    $10      |    $0B    |  Volume Label             |
|    $1B      |    $01    |  Volume Number High byte  |
|    $1C      |    $01    |  Volume Number Low byte   |
|    $1D      |    $01    |  First User Track         |
|    $1E      |    $01    |  First User Sector        |
|    $1F      |    $01    |  Last User Track          |
|    $20      |    $01    |  Last User Sector         |
|    $21      |    $01    |  Total Sectors High byte  |
|    $22      |    $01    |  Total Sectors Low byte   |
